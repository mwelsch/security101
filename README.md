# Starting over in 2025
My first project is going to be in remote-control. Goal: A program which establishes a reverse connection with a server and allows the server to make keyboard (&mouse) inputs. Currently making it for Windows. This could be run once I have gained access to a system, e.g. via a BadUSB. Persistancy or privilage escalation might be added once the program runs. If a network admin analyzes the traffic it should come accros as legitimate HTTP(S) traffic

# Security 101

I am playing around with security in my free time and want to write down very basic stuff so I can always access it easily.
My base system is Manjaro, with Blackarch packages installed.


I am not responsible for anything but my own doings
